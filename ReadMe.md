to access the add-on after you add it to your website you can add a button or card or any linking method to make it 
accessable or you can just type the full url as an example my website dashboard add-on is accessable with 
https://mahdiyasser.site/dashboard 
amd for all the add-ons to work you have to host them in a web server like apache2 or ngnix or if you host your
website with a hosting provider just put the add-on folder in the site and it will work 
and if you use github pages to host your site most of them will work unless there is backend included
