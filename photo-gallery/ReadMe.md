## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Effortless Setup:** Automatically loads images named 1 through 250 from the images/ folder, checking for common file types (.png, .jpg, etc.). CRITICAL NOTE: You cannot add files like 1.png and then try to add another file named 1.webp, because only the first one found will show up.
* **Three Themes:** Instantly switch between Soft Light, Soft Dark, and Mixed themes.
* **Clean Layout:** Images are displayed in a clean, 2-column grid that respects their original proportions.
* **Full-Screen Viewer:** Click any image to open it in a modal with arrow navigation and keyboard support.
